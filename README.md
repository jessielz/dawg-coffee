> students.washington.edu/jessielz/info343/dawg-coffee

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> Yes! I received help from Stella Ding and Sayna Parsi. I also helped Stella.

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> No. I don't have time for that.

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> 15 hours (spread out over four days).

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> I struggled to understand Bootstrap since I had never used it before. I also struggled with making the code look exactly as I wanted, which is a pretty common challenge anyway! In the future, I would definitely recommend warning students about media queries and nuances of Bootstrap, and I highly recommend pair programming. To make the challenge better, it would be nice to include the scale of the images (for example, is the image on your challenge page 768px wide?). I would include a sample web page that uses similar concepts (such as pencil).
